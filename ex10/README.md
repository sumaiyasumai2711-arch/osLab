# PROGRAM 10 : LINUX FILE PERMISSION AND FILE INFORMATION

## AIM :
To study Linux file permissions and retrieve file metadata using `stat()` and related system calls.

## CONTEXT :
**Metadata:** Metadata is data tabout data, for example; file size, permissions, etc...

This program demonstrates how to retrieve and display file metadata in the Linux operating system using the stat() system call. It accepts a filename from the user, obtains information about the file, and displays following details:

| Metadata Field | Explanation |
|---|---|
| File Size | The total size of the file measured in bytes. |
| Inode Number | A unique number that identifies a file in the Linux file system. |
| Owner | The user who owns or created the file. |
| Group | The group of users associated with the file. |
| Permissions | Specifies who can read, write, or execute the file. |
| Number of Hard Links | The number of directory entries that point to the same file. |
| File Timestamps | Records when the file was last accessed, modified, or its metadata was changed. |
